🧮 Expression Calculator Project

📌 Overview

The Expression Calculator Project is a Python-based program that can evaluate mathematical expressions entered by the user. It supports operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, and parentheses for order of operations.

This project helps beginners understand:

How to take user input
How to process and evaluate expressions
Error handling for invalid inputs
Using Python’s in-built features or modules like eval or ast safely
It acts like a mini scientific calculator on the command line.

⚙ Tools Used

Python 3.x → Core programming language
Math module (optional) → For advanced functions like sqrt(), sin(), cos()
Command Line Interface (CLI) → For user interaction
✨ Features

✅ Basic Arithmetic – Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (), Division (/) ✅ Exponents – Use ** for power (e.g., 2*3 = 8) ✅ Parentheses Support – Maintains correct order of operations ✅ Error Handling – Handles invalid expressions or divide-by-zero errors ✅ Extendable – Can be expanded to support trigonometry, logarithms, etc.

▶ How to Run

Install Python
Make sure Python 3.x is installed. Check with:

python --version
Download Project File
Save the program as expression_calculator.py.

3. Run the Program
Open terminal (or CMD) in the folder and run:

python expression_calculator.py
(or python3 expression_calculator.py)

Enter Expressions
When prompted, type a mathematical expression like:

Enter expression: (2 + 3) * 4
Result: 20
The calculator will display the evaluated result.

Exit the Program
Type exit to quit the calculator.
